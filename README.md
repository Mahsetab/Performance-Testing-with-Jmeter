# Performance-Testing-with-Jmeter
Performance Testing Summary
Overview
Performance testing was conducted on a web application using Apache JMeter to evaluate its scalability, reliability, and response time under different load conditions.

Scope
Load Testing: Assessed system behavior under normal and peak loads.
Stress Testing: Identified application breaking points.
Spike Testing: Measured response to sudden traffic surges.
Latency & Throughput Analysis: Evaluated system performance metrics.
Activities
Designed and executed detailed test scenarios.
Developed a test plan outlining objectives and methodology.
Configured virtual users and test parameters in JMeter.
Collected performance metrics for analysis.
Documented performance bottlenecks and recommendations.
Tools Used
Apache JMeter (Performance Testing)
JMeter Plugins (Enhanced reporting & visualization)
Excel/Google Sheets (Test metrics tracking)
Outcomes
Identified response time trends and system limitations.
Reported critical performance bottlenecks.
Ensured scalability and stability through iterative testing.
Conclusion
Performance testing validated the system's ability to handle various traffic conditions, contributing to optimized performance and reliability.
